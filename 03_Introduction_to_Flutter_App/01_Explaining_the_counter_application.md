When we create a new project in **VSCode**, Flutter will create a counter application, which is an application that has a floating action button; when you click it, it will increase the text number in the center of the app.

For now, let's discover this app, then modify it.

1. Open the emulator.

   > Note: we explained before how to run the application on emulator “03 run the Application”.

2. After you open the emulator, Run the app

   > Note: check step 5, “03 run the Application”.

3. The counter application will appear. Press the Floating button, you will see that the number will increase ^\_^.
