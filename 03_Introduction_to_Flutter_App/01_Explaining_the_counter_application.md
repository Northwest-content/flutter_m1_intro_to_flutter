When we create a new project in **Flutter**, a counter application will be built, which has a floating action button. Each time you click it, it increases the number that appears in the center of the app.

For now, let's discover the app, and modify it:

1. Open the emulator.

   > Note: we explained before how to run the application on emulator “03 run the Application”.

2. Run the app

   > Note: check step 5, “03 run the Application”.

3. The counter application will appear on the screen. Press the Floating button, you will see that the number increasing.
