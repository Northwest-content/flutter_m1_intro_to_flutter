When we create the application interface in Flutter we make a composition of widgets by nesting them one inside the other.

8. In our example, we will use **Text** widget which helps us to draw text inside an app. We will draw "**Hello World ^\_^**" text inside the app, and we will pass the **Text** widget inside the **body** named arguments that's inside the **Scaffold** widget.

   ```dart
   class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         body: Text('Hello World ^_^'),  // <--- Here
       );
     }
   }
   ```

9. After that, we will see our **Hello World** text be on the top left of the screen.
