#### **Let's start :)**

1. In the **main.dart** file, remove all the code. Type the "**main method**" and the "**runApp function**" as shown below.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

In the upcoming lessons, we will understand the meaning of **method** and **function**. Flutter needs them to build our App.
