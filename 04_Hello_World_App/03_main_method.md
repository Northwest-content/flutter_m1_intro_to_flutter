#### **Let's start :)**

1. First, we will open the **main.dart** file and we will remove all the code inside it.

2. In the **main.dart**, type the "**main method**" and "**runApp function**" as shown below. In upcoming lessons, we will understand the meaning of **method** and **function**. Flutter will need these codes to build our App.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```
