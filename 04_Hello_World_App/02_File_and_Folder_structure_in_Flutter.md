When we create a new Flutter app, it generates some files and folders that are the base of our app. In the future, we will understand and use some of these files and folders. Right now, we will use the first folder which is called "lib".

#### **lib folder**

This folder contains all of our dart files that end with the `.dart` extension. As you can see in (Figure #1.1.1), our lib folder has a `main.dart` file.

#### **main.dart file**

This is the most important file. It is what Flutter relies on to build the app. It should always be placed in the root of the "lib" folder, and its name shouldn't get changed.
