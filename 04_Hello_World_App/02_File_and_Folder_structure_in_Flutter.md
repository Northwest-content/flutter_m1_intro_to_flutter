When we create a new Flutter app project, Flutter will generate some files and folders that are the base of our Flutter app. In the future, we will understand and use some of these files and folders. Right now, we will use the first folder called "lib".

#### **lib folder**

This folder contains all our dart files; files that end with the `.dart` extension, and we will use it a lot. As you see in (Figure #1.1.1), our lib folder has a `main.dart` file.

#### **main.dart file**

This is the most important file, Flutter will need it to build our App, and we should not change its name, and this file should be the root of the **lib** folder.
