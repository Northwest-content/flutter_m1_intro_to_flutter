4. Let's create our Home Screen widget, which will take the **Scaffold** widget.

> **Scaffold Widget**: when you want to create a new screen in Flutter, we use the **Scaffold** widget.

    ```dart
    class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(

        );
      }
    }
    ```

5. We will edit the **MyApp** widget, and we will use the body named argument inside the **MaterialApp** widget.

> Each widget will have named arguments, such as **body**, **child**, **appBar**, etc..; Each **named argument** has a specific job. For example, in our case, we use **home:** named arguments that inside **MaterialApp**. This named argument will help us to show the home screen, so here we pass **HomeScreen** widget that we created before.

    ```dart
    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
          home: HomeScreen(),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
